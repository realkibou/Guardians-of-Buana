# 3rd Epoch
Shyama, the Godess of Darkness, is gaining more followers and power. Once she has enough, the 3rd epoch will end and the 4th will start. This cannot be stopped as it will be happening in the background, however the effects will be noticed by the players.

## Prolog - World of Buana
Welcome to World of Buana. A new world there were lush jungles, sparkling beaches, and big cities full of people and creatures. Each place had its own special ways of living and its own unique customs.

Full of majestic mountains, winding rivers, and dense forests, all of which are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, Buana is truly a gem of natures beauty. The jungles of Buana are particularly noteworthy, as they are filled with exotic creatures like giant snakes, colorful birds and many other mystical things not yet discovered or hidden away and forgotten about.

That is because: Where is there is light there is darkness. Buana is not without its dangers. Deadly predators, and the seas are home to fearsome sea monsters. Even the cities of Buana can be dangerous places, as political intrigue and criminal activity are common.

---
Right now you all are on a sailing boat heading to auspicious world. You smell the salt-laden air mixed with the smell of fresh tar on the ship's deck, creating a heady aroma that seemed to invigorate the senses. You hear the sailors shout orders to one another ("Belay that line! Trim the sail!"), the creaking of the wooden planks beneath their feet echoing across the water.

As the ship gained momentum, the sounds of the waves slapping against the sides of the vessel grew louder. The rhythmic motion of the boat created a hypnotic sway, and the gentle rocking caused the sailors to adjust their footing to maintain their balance.

The boat sailing to the great city of Tirtakencana. You have heard legends about this city where the phrase "Water is life and holy" really comes into effect. It is the capital of the so called The Nourishers. They worship the god Keshava, the God of Nourishment and Healing. Water in their believe contains the spirit of Keshava and needs to be protected.

What brings you here is only known to you maybe its the promise of new knowledge, new magical powers, fortune, courisoty or does something dark unable to describe pulls you there? Only you can know.

Onboard the ship, the crew was bustling with activity. The cook was preparing a hearty meal in the galley, the smell of spices and stew filling the air. The captain barked out orders from the helm, and the first mate scurried around the deck, making sure everything was in order.

Underdeck where also the quarters are, are many people and creates alike. Some of them already sick gaunt from their long jorney. But you see in all their eyes hope for the new.

Rest up, stock supplies. Quests from [Ketut] High Council for Banau Tapel and the north. Parcel delivery to [Victor]. Info about Rifts and quest given to reach Pattana Nana.

Summary:
The group is looking to set in the city, explore maybe a bit, stock supplies. They get rewarded for bringing the survivors to the town, make the local news and get the attention of [Ketut] High Council. Asking them about the incidend of the crash landing, and looking for potential evidence what may have caused the crab to attack. There are rumors and story going around that the water of the north is becoming corputed and polluted. Nobody knows anything really for sure, since Tirtakencana is quite far away. But if the rumors are true this is somthing of high significance and unsettling.

[Ketut] will then invite the group to another quest (to see if they are worth it/to be trusted) to travel to Banua Tapel and see what is going on there. Banua Tapel are the ruins of the ancient ancestors and should never be entered to not disturb the guardians that are inhabiting the place. However, evidence has been reported as such that the water flowing from there has turned dark, and that a suffering-sounding panther-like roar has been echoing through the night. The group is send to investigate.


In addition they delivery the parcel to [Victor], a quirly crazy mad scientist, halfling with big eyes, that is explaning them about the content of the parcel. It contains a magical shard that is used to open rifts into a higher plane of existance, but that is all he knows. Yet, the group is tasked to bring it to his friend [KlaewKla] in Pattana Nana.

Setting:
Tirtakencana, "abundant holy water", rivers and cancel flow through all the city. Water is essential here. There are many fountains, complex "Wasserspiele" where water flows from one container to another, that makes you wonder how all of this stays in sync and in perfect balance. The water's gravitational energy is also used to run complex machines. The entire city is basically a clockwork run by water as its main energy source.  

Banua Tapel:
Banua Tapel means "Village of Masks". The village or rather its ruins are upstream a mangrove forest river delta. The inhabitants before were exceptional craftsmen with wood carvings etc. mainly masks. Their masks are worth a fortune and legends says that they may have been magical powers, some may carved from the bones of the gods. However, most of the place has been raided and potential treasures have been taken already.

In the center however is a temple like in Indian Jones' Raider of the Lost Ark. Weathered and wittered in appearance. The temple is filled with traps, animal ghost monsters, spectres, and cultists, darkling?

The temple contains the most important artifact, the mask of Barong. Which is a pather-like mask, that is actually carved from the bones of Keshava and will be relevant way later in the story to summon the guardian of Keshava Bargon to fight against the darkness. However, the spirit of Barong has been fallen ill by the darkness of Shyama. That is also why the water turned dark. In an epic boss fight they have to fight the bad spirit of Barong, and in turn receive the mask of Barong as a reward, and the water will turn clear again.

# Quests
## The dark markings and missing daugther
The adventurers arrive in the town of Varden, a bustling trading hub located at the foot of the towering Mount Drog'kaz. They are soon approached by a middle-aged half-elf named Elarion, who introduces himself as a prominent member of the town council.

Elarion explains that Varden has been experiencing a string of strange occurrences lately. People have reported hearing eerie whispers in the night, and several buildings have been found vandalized with strange markings. The town guard has been unable to get to the bottom of the matter, and the council fears that something dark and sinister may be afoot.

Elarion believes that the adventurers may be just the people to help. He shares that he has a personal stake in this, as his daughter, Saria, has gone missing. She was last seen heading towards the nearby forest of Gorgunuk, and Elarion fears that she may have been abducted by whatever force is causing the disturbances in Varden.

The council has offered a reward of 500 gold pieces for any information on the cause of these strange occurrences and the safe return of Saria. Elarion implores the adventurers to investigate and promises to provide them with any additional information and assistance they may need.

The adventurers' objective is to investigate the strange occurrences in Varden and the disappearance of Elarion's daughter. They must explore the town and surrounding areas, gather clues and information, and ultimately track down the source of the disturbances and Saria's whereabouts. Along the way, they may face various challenges, including battles with dangerous creatures, deciphering cryptic messages and symbols, and navigating treacherous terrain.

Quest Giver: Eshara, the High Priestess of The Nourishers

Quest Objective: The Nourishers are a faction of druids and healers who have been tasked with maintaining the balance of nature and keeping the world of Buana healthy and thriving. Recently, Eshara, the High Priestess of The Nourishers, has become increasingly concerned about a disturbing trend she has noticed in the natural world.

The rivers and lakes that once flowed clear and pure have become polluted, and the forests that were once teeming with life are now sick and dying. Eshara fears that someone or something is causing this imbalance and threatens the delicate ecosystem of Buana.

The objective of this quest is to investigate the cause of this imbalance and restore the natural balance of Buana. The adventurers will be tasked with finding the source of the pollution and putting an end to it. They will need to gather information from various sources, explore the affected areas, and confront the culprits responsible for the imbalance.

Upon completion of the quest, the adventurers will be rewarded with the knowledge of the Nourishers, a deeper understanding of the importance of preserving the balance of nature, and the gratitude of Eshara and her fellow Nourishers. Additionally, the adventurers will be given a magical amulet that provides a small boost to their healing abilities and a boon to their connection with nature.
