# Quests
## The dark markings and missing daugther
The adventurers arrive in the town of Varden, a bustling trading hub located at the foot of the towering Mount Drog'kaz. They are soon approached by a middle-aged half-elf named Elarion, who introduces himself as a prominent member of the town council.

Elarion explains that Varden has been experiencing a string of strange occurrences lately. People have reported hearing eerie whispers in the night, and several buildings have been found vandalized with strange markings. The town guard has been unable to get to the bottom of the matter, and the council fears that something dark and sinister may be afoot.

Elarion believes that the adventurers may be just the people to help. He shares that he has a personal stake in this, as his daughter, Saria, has gone missing. She was last seen heading towards the nearby forest of Gorgunuk, and Elarion fears that she may have been abducted by whatever force is causing the disturbances in Varden.

The council has offered a reward of 500 gold pieces for any information on the cause of these strange occurrences and the safe return of Saria. Elarion implores the adventurers to investigate and promises to provide them with any additional information and assistance they may need.

The adventurers' objective is to investigate the strange occurrences in Varden and the disappearance of Elarion's daughter. They must explore the town and surrounding areas, gather clues and information, and ultimately track down the source of the disturbances and Saria's whereabouts. Along the way, they may face various challenges, including battles with dangerous creatures, deciphering cryptic messages and symbols, and navigating treacherous terrain.

## The Nourishers' Call - Gather Info of Pullution
Quest Giver: Eshara, the High Priestess of The Nourishers

Quest Objective: The Nourishers are a faction of druids and healers who have been tasked with maintaining the balance of nature and keeping the world of Buana healthy and thriving. Recently, Eshara, the High Priestess of The Nourishers, has become increasingly concerned about a disturbing trend she has noticed in the natural world.

The rivers and lakes that once flowed clear and pure have become polluted, and the forests that were once teeming with life are now sick and dying. Eshara fears that someone or something is causing this imbalance and threatens the delicate ecosystem of Buana.

The objective of this quest is to investigate the cause of this imbalance and restore the natural balance of Buana. The adventurers will be tasked with finding the source of the pollution and putting an end to it. They will need to gather information from various sources, explore the affected areas, and confront the culprits responsible for the imbalance.

Upon completion of the quest, the adventurers will be rewarded with the knowledge of the Nourishers, a deeper understanding of the importance of preserving the balance of nature, and the gratitude of Eshara and her fellow Nourishers. Additionally, the adventurers will be given a magical amulet that provides a small boost to their healing abilities and a boon to their connection with nature.
