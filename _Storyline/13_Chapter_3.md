## Objectives:
Rest up, stock supplies. Quests from [Ketut] High Council for Banau Tapel and the north. Parcel delivery to [Victor]. Info about Rifts and quest given to reach Pattana Nana.

## Summary:
The group is looking to set in the city, explore maybe a bit, stock supplies. They get rewarded for bringing the survivors to the town, make the local news and get the attention of [Ketut] High Council. Asking them about the incidend of the crash landing, and looking for potential evidence what may have caused the crab to attack. There are rumors and story going around that the water of the north is becoming corputed and polluted. Nobody knows anything really for sure, since Tirtakencana is quite far away. But if the rumors are true this is somthing of high significance and unsettling.

[Ketut] will then invite the group to another quest (to see if they are worth it/to be trusted) to travel to Banua Tapel and see what is going on there. Banua Tapel are the ruins of the ancient ancestors and should never be entered to not disturb the guardians that are inhabiting the place. However, evidence has been reported as such that the water flowing from there has turned dark, and that a suffering-sounding panther-like roar has been echoing through the night. The group is send to investigate.

In addition they delivery the parcel to [Victor], a quirly crazy mad scientist, halfling with big eyes, that is explaning them about the content of the parcel. It contains a magical shard that is used to open rifts into a higher plane of existance, but that is all he knows. Yet, the group is tasked to bring it to his friend [KlaewKla] in Pattana Nana.

## Setting:
Tirtakencana, "abundant holy water", rivers and cancel flow through all the city. Water is essential here. There are many fountains, complex "Wasserspiele" where water flows from one container to another, that makes you wonder how all of this stays in sync and in perfect balance. The water's gravitational energy is also used to run complex machines. The entire city is basically a clockwork run by water as its main energy source.  

Banua Tapel means "Village of Masks". The village or rather its ruins are upstream a mangrove forest river delta. The inhabitants before were exceptional craftsmen with wood carvings etc. mainly masks. Their masks are worth a fortune and legends says that they may have been magical powers, some may carved from the bones of the gods. However, most of the place has been raided and potential treasures have been taken already.

In the center however is a temple like in Indian Jones' Raider of the Lost Ark. The entrance to the temple is hidden in a way, that it has been overgrown with trees. That has to be found first and then chopped down. Evidence of a former camp and adventure supplies give a hint of the direction to the entrace. Weathered and wittered in appearance.

The temple contains the most important artifact, the mask of Barong. Which is a pather-like mask, that is actually carved from the bones of Keshava and will be relevant way later in the story to summon the guardian of Keshava Bargon to fight against the darkness. However, the spirit of Barong has been fallen ill by the darkness of Shyama. That is also why the water turned dark. In an epic boss fight they have to fight the bad spirit of Barong, and in turn receive the mask of Barong as a reward, and the water will turn clear again.

## Banua Tapel
Spectures, Guarding spellse, Culists, in the center, Gardgind spells

1. Entrance *TRAP 1 – Cobweb*  
A bunch of spiders crawling over the PCs and they need to figure out how to get them off before getting bitten and poisoned. Poison (Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks).
2. Expeditions Camp  
A bunch of expedition supplies are stored here from former adventureres that wanted to make their way in. Ropes, rotten food supplies, torches, nails, empty and cracked barrels etc.
3. The Pillar - *Easy 4x75 = 300 XP*
From here the temple can be marveled at. A ripping river below full of the dark water observed before Stalactites are handing from the ceiling. The sound of the river if echoing through the entire temple. Making it very difficult to hear anything beyond that. One big boulder falls of the pillar and crashes down. Out of nowhere then the group is attacked by 3 Giant Bats. Towards the end of the fight, the entire pillar will give in, collaps and fall over, blocking partly the river below.
4. First room  
The group can gather themselves after espacing the collapsing pillar. The way back is now completly cut off and the group has to continue forward. Once they are about to leave the area they here the panther-like roar that sounds very dark, hollow and a bit suffering echoching through the temple. Dust and sand starts trickle down on the groups heads.
5. First hallway
If they take the time to investigate they can find a door to a secret passage to 9. Otherwise they will need to find a way over the gaping hole to the next area. Where was once a bridge before, is now a gaping hole. Only some rotten wodden posts where a bridge was tied to are left. Are the sturdy enough? If a member falls, they can limit the damage by targeting the deeper parts in the river below, but will be washed out the temple. Maybe they can hold on the pillar in 3?
6. Secound hallway  
This is a mirror of the first hallway, however the small niche from 5 is now bricked of or rather hidden. The PCs can investigate to find a a hidden niche 6 and/or the secret passage to 7.
6a. Following the stairs down lead into a storage room with plenty of pots that contain rotten oils for fires, tar, cotton rags, some arrow heads, spears, darts, etc.
6b. A small side room with some gold pieces and a wooden mask. 
7. *TRAP 2 – SPIKE TRAP Easy 4x75 = 300 XP*  
Somehow triggered by interrupting a beam of sunlight, this is clearly a magical trap and the group needs to use your Intelligence (Arcana) skill to detect it. Trap can be disabled by triggering it in a controlled way however the trap will reset after a while.
8. The Dig  
Former adventureres who have been here, and did not find the secret way started digging through the stone to create their own passage. The PC can continue here and will find the way to the other side and ultimately a bridge. However a boulder blocks the way to the left, so they have to cross to the right.
9. *TRAP 3 – DART TRAP Easy 4x75 = 300 XP*  
Next we have the (probably poison) dart trap. One a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check, the group will find the trigger. Once the trigger is identified (camouflaged with a covering of dirt), the group can easily recognize the other triggers. Either disabling it or instead makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to make their way across the room.
10. *TRAP 4 – THE ARENA Mid 4x150 = 600 XP*  
Once the PC enter this room full of bones on the bottom. Suddenly all doors close and lock. And a fight beginns like in a area. 2x Skeletons swap and after one more round 2x Skeletal Alchemist and 1x Swarm of bones summoned by the Alchemists.
11.   Third Hallway
Almost looking like living quarters. Quite homey. A door is leading to area 12 and 14. Once they enter the are hearing the panther-like roar again, louder and closer.
12.   The carveres quarters  
Looks like someone was living here before. It has been quite some time, but there are notes about masks, different carvings, drawings of a pather-like creature.
13.   Secret room
Hidden in this room are books about lore of the ancient epoches, specifially about Keshava and their sibblings. As well as a diary that is blank after the first page. It is only visible what is written in it to the owner. It looks like that some page has been written, but of course can't be read. However the PC's can attune to it and make it their own. 
14.   Fourth Hallway
A normal hallway with a small makeshift bridge to the next area as well as another room around the corner.
15.   The room of masks
The wall is full of wodden masks, some of them simple some of them are very delicate and beautiful. However, there has been a change here. The room looks relativly fresh. Less dust, some crates have been moved.
16. *BOSS FIGHT Hard 4x225 = 900 XP*

17.   After the boss fight the shaky bridge will fall into the river, but a big crack in the wall opens to the left of the PCs. This seems to be the most promising and only exit as of now. However, as they exit a big boulder breaks lose and chases the group. (this is bassically like a chase, however the PC are not the ones chaseing, but being chased.)
