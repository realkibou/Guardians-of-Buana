## 3rd Epoch
Shyama, the Godess of Darkness, is gaining more followers and power. Once she has enough, the 3rd epoch will end and the 4th will start. This cannot be stopped as it will be happening in the background, however the effects will be noticed by the players.

### Prolog - World of Buana
Welcome to World of Buana. A new world there were lush jungles, sparkling beaches, and big cities full of people and creatures. Each place had its own special ways of living and its own unique customs.

Full of majestic mountains, winding rivers, and dense forests, all of which are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, Buana is truly a gem of natures beauty. The jungles of Buana are particularly noteworthy, as they are filled with exotic creatures like giant snakes, colorful birds and many other mystical things not yet discovered or hidden away and forgotten about.

That is because: Where is there is light there is darkness. Buana is not without its dangers. Deadly predators, and the seas are home to fearsome sea monsters. Even the cities of Buana can be dangerous places, as political intrigue and criminal activity are common.

Right now you all are on a sailing boat heading to auspicious world. You smell the salt-laden air mixed with the smell of fresh tar on the ship's deck, creating a heady aroma that seemed to invigorate the senses. You hear the sailors shout orders to one another ("Belay that line! Trim the sail!"), the creaking of the wooden planks beneath their feet echoing across the water.

As the ship gained momentum, the sounds of the waves slapping against the sides of the vessel grew louder. The rhythmic motion of the boat created a hypnotic sway, and the gentle rocking caused the sailors to adjust their footing to maintain their balance.

The boat sailing to the great city of Tirtakencana. You have heard legends about this city where the phrase "Water is life and holy" really comes into effect. It is the capital of the so called The Nourishers. They worship the god Keshava, the God of Nourishment and Healing. Water in their believe contains the spirit of Keshava and needs to be protected.

What brings you here is only known to you maybe its the promise of new knowledge, new magical powers, fortune, courisoty or does something dark unable to describe pulls you there? Only you can know.

Onboard the ship, the crew was bustling with activity. The cook was preparing a hearty meal in the galley, the smell of spices and stew filling the air. The captain barked out orders from the helm, and the first mate scurried around the deck, making sure everything was in order.

Underdeck where also the quarters are, are many people and creates alike. Some of them already sick gaunt from their long jorney. But you see in all their eyes hope for the new.
