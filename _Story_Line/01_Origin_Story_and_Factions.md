# Origin Story of Guana
## 1st Epoch - The Beginning
It is believed that when *The Four-Headed Creator* who goes by many names (Hindu: Brahma, Chinese: Simianshen, Japan: Bonten; Tibetan: Fantian), the embodiment of time and everything itself, opened his eyes, the universe came into existence out of nothing. There was no before, it all began right there and then.

He then summoned the four gods that we call *The Gods of Buana*:

### Khanike, the Godess of War
Khanike, the Godess of War, Mongolian, female, (Attributes: Warrior, Leader): Wise and just ruler who governs over all other deities and the mortal realm. In some Chinese folklore, she is also portrayed as a powerful warrior who defeated demons and other evil forces to establish peace and order in the universe.

### Shyama, the Godess of Darkness
Shyama, the Godess of Darkness, Sanskrit (Kali), female, "black, dark", (Attributes: Feeling of strong emotions, **not** simply evil): The goddess of destruction and transformation in Hinduism, who is often depicted with a fierce and terrifying appearance. Kali is also associated with time and change, and is often worshipped as a protective deity.
  
### Isuan, the God of Life & Creation
Isuan, the God of life & creation, [Thai (Shiva)], female, (Attributes: Wisdom, Knowledge, Creation, Life: The destroyer god in Hinduism, who is also associated with creation and renewal. Shiva is often depicted with a third eye, which represents spiritual insight and knowledge.

### Keshava, the God of Nourishment and Healing
Keshava, the God of Nourishment and Healing, [Sanskrit (Vishnu)], female, "she who has long hair", (Attributes: Support, Harmony, Balancer): The preserver god in Hinduism, who is responsible for maintaining the balance between good and evil in the world. Vishnu is often depicted with multiple arms and holding various symbolic objects.

After the creation of the gods *The Creator* closed his eyes on his left head, as he was tired from the creation.

## 2nd Epoch - The Past
*The Creator* took good care of his children, educated and played with them. However, there was always a fight between them for the love of their creator, because love was not equally shared between them all. So it came one day that Shyama, the goddess of darkness, turned into a rage due to jealousy and started a fight with Khanike.

It was a relentless fight that lasted for millennia. None of the siblings could calm them down. And, what will happen will happen. Shyama struck a fatal blow against Khanike. Khanike bleeding out, fell over and took her last breath. However, where the blood fell, land was born. Where the last breath went, the wind was created, and where the body fell, mountains rose.

Isuan, the god of life & creation, devastated by the death of his sister, tried to use her energy of creation to revive Khanike, but did not succeed, at least not quite. She dissolved into thousands of droplets that created all animate life on Buana. We call that energy **Shakti**.

Seeing this, Keshava the god of balance & wisdom, recognized that the just created life will not last, if it would not be nourished. In commemoration, Keshava gave her life to create the clouds, rain, ocean, seas and rivers so the sacrifice of her siblings will not go to waste.

Shyama however internally cheered as she was now the only remaining god to receive all the love of her creator. But once *The Creator* recognized what had happened, but conflicted to lose his final child too, she banished Shyama into the light, but allowed her to return once per day.

Yet, disappointed in herself for having created the gods itself and therefore being indirectly responsible, *The Creator* closed his eyes on his middle head in shame.

## 3rd Epoch - The New Age
Since the gods died, the world was fractured many times. Wars between the creations shaped and divided Buana into what you know now.

Some mystery remains. It is reported that some creatures found a way to access and cultivate the **Shakti** within. They can use that energy to gain enlightenment to reach a higher level of existence step by step. Some may even get specific God's blessings.

The remnants of these wars will be slowly uncovered throughout the world but since this is the New Age where everything old has been reduced to ruins.

## The Future - 4th Epoch, the closing of the eye
What happens in the 4th Epoch or what brings us there, is unknown. Some believe that when *The Creator* closes its last pair of eyes, the world restarts. That's the mythos.

# Races / Factions / Kingdoms
## The Warforged (Khanike) / Mongolian
There are several factions in this adventure. Let me tell you about The Warforged: They believe to be the descendants of the god Khanike and speak Mongolian. They are living in the cold and harsh north of the world. They are a war loving, conquering, honor driven faction similar to the Klingons from Star Trek or Gengnis Khan. Their main objective is to restore honor and glory for their fallen god Khanike.

The Warforged live to die in a glourious battle. They see war & combat as an expressive artform. Naturally they only respect only very combat-acomblished people. They are not brutal, neither raging, rather calculative, but very much opportunists.

## The Fellowship of Isuan (Isuan) / Thai
Another faction is The Fellowship of Isuan. They speak Thai and worship the God Isuan. This faction consists of knowledgeable creatures that perfected the study and flow with *Shakti* energy. They care for all animated objects, as they see them as life and they accumulate knowledge. Some of them have become supreme beings ("lower gods") through the path of enlightenment. They are also obsessed with nature's creations, specifically flowers as they are fascinated by their patterns, harmony and complex smell.

### Religious aspect
The Fellowship of Isuan believes that the Shakti energy should be used for the betterment of all, and not just for the selfish desires of a few. The Fellowship stronghold is a fortified island covered by a magic shield right in the middle of the Thale Jorakhae Coean where they store their vast collection of magical tomes and artifacts. They are known for their expertise in divination and abjuration magic, and are often called upon to advise rulers and leaders in times of crisis.

They are a diverse folk as they don't care for race but only what knowledge can be added from new members and inhabitants. The entire city of Pattana Nana is supposed to be built on top of the ruins of Isuan, one of the Highgods. Here they secretly use Isuan's knowledge to advance in cultivation and technology. All inhabitants are in general taller, well nourished, calm and well spoken. Plus, more sensitive to the energies. They prime themselves as the Guardians of the world. But are secretive, manipulative and cunning.

Over time, the Order has become more selective in their recruitment of new members, choosing only those who share their beliefs and ideals. They are fiercely independent and prefer to remain neutral in political conflicts, but will not hesitate to intervene if they believe that magic is being used for evil purposes.

### Convtroversies
The Fellowship thinks and believes as a collective. The greater good is the only good, think like Borg of Star Trek. They do not despise others, but they are utilitarists.

### How Shakti works
The meditation aspect is basically same in Hinduism and Buddhism. It's called Tapasya and it's basically sitting in a meditative pose to connect with God or the World's energy. This is how people will gain enlightenment. 

### Subgroup: "The Guardians of the Rift"
There is sub-faction east to The Fellowship of Isuan, call The Guardians of the Rift. The Guardians of the Rift are a mysterious faction of individuals who are devoted to protecting the world from the dangers that lurk within the rifts between planes. They believe that the rifts are the key to unlocking untold power and knowledge, but that they also pose a great threat to the world if left unguarded.

Legend has it that the faction was formed by a powerful wizard who discovered a rift to another plane and witnessed the horrors that lay beyond it. He realized that the rifts could not be allowed to remain unguarded and gathered a group of like-minded individuals to form the Guardians of the Rift. The faction is made up of powerful mages, skilled warriors, and cunning rogues, all united in their dedication to protecting the world from the rifts. They are known to be secretive and reclusive, with their headquarters hidden deep in the mountains.

The Guardians of the Rift are known to have a complex network of safe houses and hideouts throughout the world, allowing them to quickly respond to any threat to the rifts. They often work alone, but have been known to form temporary alliances with other factions in times of crisis.

The Guardians of the Rift are also known to have access to powerful magic and artifacts, some of which they have acquired through their travels to other planes. They are feared and respected by many, and their presence is often a sign that something dangerous is happening in the world.

## The Disciples of Darkness (Shyama) / Lao
Another faction in the north east are The Disciples of Darkness which worship Shyama the god of Darkness and speak Lao Language. The Disciples of Darkness is a powerful and ancient faction of dark magic users who have been practicing their craft for centuries. They believe that the darkness holds the key to ultimate power and seek to spread it throughout the world, subjugating all those who stand in their way.

The origins of The Disciples of Darkness are shrouded in mystery, with many believing that they were formed by a group of rogue wizards who were banished from their respective orders due to their experimentation with dark magic. Over time, the Coven grew in size and power, with its members becoming more and more obsessed with the power of darkness.

The Disciples of Darkness is known for its ruthless tactics and willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. They are experts at manipulating and corrupting others, often targeting vulnerable individuals who are easily swayed by promises of power and wealth.

Their ultimate goal is to plunge the world into eternal darkness, where they will rule as the ultimate masters of the realm. The Disciples of Darkness is a force to be reckoned with, and their power and influence continue to grow with each passing day.

However, even as they are seen as the "evil ones" in this adventure, they are actually fearful of *The Creator* and seek ultimate forgiveniss for what their god Shyama has done. They are torn between on the one hand being grateful for the creation of the world and all life due to the fight between Khanike and Shyama, and on the other hand feeling guilty for their god Shyama.

This tribe may be particularly devoted to their deity and follow his teachings closely.
