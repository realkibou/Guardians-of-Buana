On a failed Sanity save, the creature is afflicted by a short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, and its Sanit score is reduced by 1 as per the usual Sanity saves' effects."}],"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"Barong uses its Assert Dominance action and then makes one weapon attack."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

A stunned creature within 30 feet of the Barong that it can sense must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is dominated by Barong until either creature falls unconscious. A dominated creature is charmed by the Barong and the Barong has a telepathic link with the creature.\n\nBarong can also use this action again to cast the Command spell on a dominated creature, issuing its command telepathically, not requiring any saving throw, and ignoring the restriction of not being able to issue commands directly harmful to the target. If the Barong issues a command in this way, the target stops being stunned until it has brought that command to a conclusion."}],"bonusActions":[],"reactions":[{"name":"Weave Disturbance (Recharge 5-6)","desc":"When a creature within 5 feet of Barong starts casting a spell, the Barong can use its reaction to make a special claw attack against that creature before the spell is actually cast. This special attack deals psychic damage instead of the attack's normal damage type, and it disrupts the creature's casting so much that if they are concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration. This also applies if the spell that triggered this reaction requires concentration, and if this is the case and the caster loses its concentration on that spell as a result of Barong hitting it with this reaction, the caster's spell doesn't take effect, but the caster's spell slot or use of that spell is considered consumed anyway."}],"legendaries":[],"mythics":[],"lairs":[],"regionals":[],"sthrows":[{"name":"dex","order":1}],"skills":[{"name":"athletics","stat":"str"},{"name":"perception","stat":"wis"},{"name":"stealth","stat":"dex","note":" (ex)"}],"damagetypes":[{"name":"psychic","note":" (Resistant)","type":"r"}],"specialdamage":[],"conditions":[{"name":"charmed"}],"languages":[{"name":"Celestial","speaks":true},{"name":"Common","speaks":true},{"name":"Deep Speech","speaks":true}],"understandsBut":"","shortName":"","pluralName":"","doubleColumns":true,"separationPoint":0,"damage":[]}
