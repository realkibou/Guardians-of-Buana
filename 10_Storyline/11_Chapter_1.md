## Objectives
The group learns a bit about the factions, the factions' interests, religions and in general what the new world promises.

## Summary
Group is on a ship to Tirtakencana. They are directly thrown into a brawl between recriuiters **Khonemany** and **Altanchimeg**. After this has been solved, the group explores the many other immigrants wanting to start a new life, seek knowledge, join the darkside of Buana. Then again the ship gets attacked by a crab (Monster: Chuul), and crashlands in the wild.

## Setting
The group consists of individual travelers coming by ship to Tirtakencana. There are all sorts of people on the ship looking for a new opportunity, trade (they will talk about the The Caravan Guild faction), education, magical energy (The Fellowship of Isuan), the promise of fruitful land (The Peasant Collective) or just the curiosity of the new.

The factions or the idea of them are present with the other travelers. Some come specifically for that. One of the arrivals is talking about the end. The end is near, and they will be all part of it. He is going crazy and is locked up (Disciples of Darkness).

## NPCs
- Part of the "Disciples of Darkness"-Recruiters **Simok**, Drow, pride, honor and has a certain weight to his voice, quite convincing voice
- Head of the "Disciples of Darkness"-Recruiters **Khonemany**, male
- Head of the "The Warforgred"-Recruiters **Altanchimeg**, female
- **AkmenGlee**, Stats of a SwashBuckler, Common, Human, dressed grey, rather poor, he is protecting the parcel he carries with his life, he signed up for a delivery quest, but the amount of gold that he needs for his family is huge. He was instructed to trust noone. He also carries a note with an address of where to delivery the parcel.

## Quests
- GIVEN *Easy 4x75 = 300 XP*:  
Get knowledge of something/find someone. Maybe they get a note from the DoD "Looking for power and up your skills? Find me in the back of the ship"  If they go the recruiter **Simok** will tell them that there is one person on board () that carries something of great interest. They should find out who that is and tell/bring the item to the recruiter. When they try to steal it from Akmen Glee he will try to convince them with his life, that this is more important to than anything in this world to bring it. They worst case have to fight and kill him.

## Fights
- NOT GIVEN BECAUSE NOT ENGANGED *Med 4x150 = 600XP*:  
(2x Thugs, 4x Bandits) Some of the immigrants are recruiter for the different factions. They are highly competetive, so the group notices some yelling that starts into a brawl between the recruiters of (Disciples of Darkness **Khonemany**) and (The Warforged, **Altanchimeg**). The group is free to stop the both partis from fighting. Those two will group will eventuall get locked up. (Later when the ship beaches, they have a chance to go back for them).
- GIVEN *Hard 4x225 = 1100 XP*:  
(Chuul) Against a crab that is attacking the ship. Many people are thrown of board. Eventually the crab is fought of, but the ship is not in control anymore as the ruder is heading with high speed towards the riff and shore.
- GIVEN *Med 4x150 = 600XP*:  
The characters have a bit of time to act and maybe gain control of the ship before it crashes.

## Conclusion
The ship never will make it to it original destination Tirtakencana. It crashlands east to Danau Tirtaken on the east of the small Peninsula.
